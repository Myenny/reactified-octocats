This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Here is the link to my Reactified Ocotocats: domineering-bat.surge.sh

This app was built as part of my course work for Suncoast Developers Guild. The key objectives for this project were:

  - Reuse an Octodex as a starting point for this assignment. Or use an existing well factored (HTML and CSS) Octodex.
  - Figure out the main components of the page. These will be the main components in your <App> component.
  - Have should have at least two components...
  - Create a React app
  - Clear out the implementation in the render method of App and have it render your main components.
  - Create those components and paste the appropriate HTML from your Octodex into the render method of those components.
  - Break down those components and use this.props to dynamically customize the components that need it.
  
  Enjoy!
